## types of prompting
There are 3 types of prompting that we can use
1. Zero shot prompting: here we provide no example to the model about how to solve the problem. we simply ask the model to figure out of it's own
2. One-shot prompting: Here we provide one example of how the solution can be produced and we then expect the model to figure out how to solve this
3. Multi-shot prompting: Here we provide multiple examples of how the solution can be produced and we then expect the model to figure out how to solve this
