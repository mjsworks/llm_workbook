[Example 1]
Topic: Lists | Difficulty: Easy
Question: What is the output of
    x = [1, 2, 3]
    x.append(4)
    print(len(x))
Answer: 4
why: because append adds the new element to the whole list as a element. hence, it increases the original length by 1 as we are adding 1 new element


[Example 2]
Topic: Functions | Difficulty: Medium
Question: what is printed?
    def f(a, L=[]):
        L.append(a)
        return L
    print(f(1))
    print(f(2))
    print(f(3))
Answer: [1]
        [1,2]
        [1,2,3]
why: because default list is shared between calls.

[EXAMPLE 3]
Topic: Strings | Difficulty: Hard
Question: What will this print and why?
   s = "hello"
   print(s[::-1].upper())
Answer: OLLEH
Why: because s[::-1] reverses the string, then upper() capitalizes.
