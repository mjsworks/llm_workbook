[Example 1]
Question: What is the output of print ("".join(sorted(set("abaac"))))?
Hint: Think: set removes duplicates, sorted orders characters, join combines them

[Example 2]
Question: What is the output of:
    x = [1,2,3]
    print(x * 2)
Hint: Think: what happens when you multiply a list in python? Does it do element-wise or not?

[Example 3]
Question: What does d.get("z", 99) return if z is not in d?
Hint: Consider the second argument of dict.get().
